## Features 
This Extension enhances the Google search experience by providing summaries from selected websites, primarily focused on discussion forums like Reddit.

1. It adds a sidebar to Google search results pages.
The sidebar allows users to search for the same query on pre-selected websites (default: reddit.com and ycombinator.com).

2. When a user clicks on a website link in the sidebar, it fetches search results specific to that site.
The extension then displays these results in the sidebar, including titles, links, and brief descriptions.

3. If enabled and an OpenAI API key is provided, it generates a summary of the search results using GPT-4.
The summary includes citations linking back to the specific search results.

4. The extension adapts to light and dark modes based on the user's system preferences.
